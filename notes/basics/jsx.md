# JSX

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

> It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”

## Why JSX

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating *technologies* by putting markup and logic in separate files, React [separates *concerns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

React [doesn’t require](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html) using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

## Embedding Expressions in JSX

```jsx
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```

You can put any valid [JavaScript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions) inside the curly braces in JSX.

we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function

```jsx
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);
```

## JSX is an Expression Too

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

This means that you can use JSX inside of `if` statements and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

```jsx
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```

## Specifying Attributes with JSX

You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```jsx
const element = <a href="https://www.reactjs.org"> link </a>;
```

You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

```jsx
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```

## JSX Represents Objects

Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls. These two examples are identical:

```jsx
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```

```jsx
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

`React.createElement()` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```jsx
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```
