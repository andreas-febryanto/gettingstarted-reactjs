# What is React

> A JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces
> 
> can be thought of writing custom HTML element. Solve complex problems by writing maintainable, manageable and reusable pieces

## Why React ?

> - UI State becomes difficult to handle with Vanilla JavaScript
> 
> - Focus on Business Logic, not on preventing your App from exploding plus => Framework Creators probably write better Code
> 
> - Huge Ecosystem, Active Community, High Performance

# SPA vs MPA

> Single Page Applications
> 
> - Only ONE HTML Page, Content is (re)rendered on Client
> 
> - Typically only ONE ReactDOM.render() call

> Multi Page Applications
> 
> - Multiple HTML Pages, COntent is rendered on Server
> 
> - One ReactDOM.render() call per "widget"

# JSX

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

> It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”
